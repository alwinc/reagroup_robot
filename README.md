Robot Assessment Task for REA group in Java

Overview
-----------

How to build
------------
I built this robot using the awesomeness of Maven.
So if you have maven installed on your computer, all you have to do is the following commands
at the root project folder (where reagrouprobot folder exists)

`mvn clean compile assembly:single`

This will compile an executable JAR 
* reagrouprobot\target\reagrouprobot-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
with the main function in com.winnergenic.reagroup.robot.ROBOT already referenced to in the MANIFEST.MF file



Thanks
-------
Finally I'd like to say thanks for the opportunity to participate in this assessment task.
I had quite a lot of fun putting it together and continually find new ways to improve the robot.
Whether it be through fun easter eggs, by letting the robot make complaints (when asked to move off
the table), or possibly causing the robot to self-destruct.
Ultimately, I dreamed of wanting to name this robot 'terminator 2000' and allowing it to resurrect itself 
with catchy phrases like 'I'll be back', 'its NOT a tumor!' or 'get to da choppa!!!'

I had a lot fun and I sincerely thank the REA group for the opportunity and hope to hear
your feedback soon.
